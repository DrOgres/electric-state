please put any and all bug reports and feature requests in the issues of this repo.  Here is a list of things I hope to add in the comming days

TODO LIST:

- Player Character Sheets
    - Target token to use Tension on opposed rolls - pre-select target as tension source if possible
    - Target to allow damage to be applied for attacks
    - Item Detail roll Down for: Talents, Injuries, Traumas, Traits and Tension
- General styling and UI improvement for clarity and use
- Organize localization fields to make sense
- set up macro drag to hot bar for rollable elements
- Look at Robot sheet, stats and equipment may need to be handled differently
    - does it make sense to use this as the Drone Growth as well?
    - How do we handle neuroscape things?
